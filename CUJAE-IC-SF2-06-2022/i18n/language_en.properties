#-------------About---------------------------
about_title=About IAS
about_p1=Image Authentication System (IAS) is a web project that satisfies the need to be able to authenticate in said application, different from the conventional ways of logging into the systems. \It only allows a single administrator and several standard users.

about_p2=Each user has the right to have up to 5 different passwords, and these in turn are made up of 5 points, an image where they would go, and a security question. The images are chosen by the \user himself in his first authentication to the system, which he will use in his next accesses. Once the passwords are set, you are taken to the welcome page. Here you can make use of 2 reports that provide you with certain data of yours.

about_p3=Unlike the administrator, the administrator has control of all users and images, and can insert, modify and delete them. The images that the administrator inserts are those that the user \who authenticates for the first time will be able to see. Also, it presents 3 reports, which provide information about users.
